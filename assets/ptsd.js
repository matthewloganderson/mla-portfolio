<p>My maternal
grandfather died in 2005. He was 72 years old – 20 of which he spent in the
Army. He was a combat engineer in Vietnam and Korea and a drill sergeant for a
time. That, however, is all I know of those twenty years: barely a sentence,
and most of that I heard from my mother or grandmother.</p>


<p>The only thing I
can concretely remember my grandfather telling me directly about the military
was this: “Don't join the military unless there's a draft. And if there is a
draft, don't dodge it.”</p>



<p>He never spoke
much of his time, often dodging questions when asked, or letting my grandmother
answer them briefly before she artfully changed the topic of conversation.
Perhaps it was too painful, perhaps he carried a scar from his time at war. But
he came from a generation that didn't discuss those sorts of things: internal
wounds were those which one was meant to carry alone, certainly not something
to be discussed with others. </p>



<p>As these types of
wounds become more public and more discussed by a newer generation of veterans,
however, another truth becomes more clear: we, as a society, don't do enough
for vets after they leave the military. </p>



<p>That's a problem –
especially as more than two million military personnel have been deployed to
Iraq, Afghanistan, or both as of 2011. Of those, nearly one million have been
deployed twice or more, according to ABC News, something which greatly raises
the probability of a soldier sustaining some sort of wound – mental or
physical. </p>



<p><b>'A Heart Attack
was honorable, PTSD was not.'</p></b>



<p>Veterans,
especially those in active combat, are exposed to situations the rest of us can
scarcely contemplate: limbs blown from the bodies of soldiers, civilians, even
children, or the terror which comes with bullets flying passed your head only
to hit a comrade when they were meant for you. These images stay with a person
– often whether the person wishes them to or not.  </p>



<p>“Everything was
different. I felt almost alien-like, so I found myself having to relearn how to
communicate with people who don't have like interests, don't have like beliefs,
don't have like backgrounds,” Natasha Young told The Huffington Post. </p>



<p>Post-Traumatic
Stress Disorder (PTSD), as the name suggests, is a condition which can arise
after an individual is exposed to one or more traumatic events which can
include sexual assault, serious injury or the threat of death among others.
Symptoms often include flashbacks, nightmares, feelings of detachment,
irritability, trouble concentrating, and sleeplessness. </p>



<p>“I could not stand
being here anymore. I could not stand being in America, just living my life the
way everybody else does,” Michael Zacchea, an Iraq veteran, told PBS. “I didn't
sleep for four or five days at a time. I couldn't go to sleep, couldn't relax,
couldn't let myself go.” </p>



<p>The US department
of Veterans Affairs estimates that over 30 percent of Vietnam vets, nearly 10
percent of Desert Storm vets, 11 percent of Afghanistan vets, and 20 percent of
Iraq war veterans suffer from PTSD. A VA report published in October of 2012 concluded
that of the 834,463 Iraq and Afghanistan veterans treated in VA hospitals,
247,243 have been diagnosed with PTSD – 29.6 percent. </p>



<p>As if PTSD alone
wasn't enough to deal with, the disorder often presents with a host of other
issues including substance abuse, depression, or other disorder. Between 36.9
and 50.2 percent of veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan in the VA healthcare
system have received a mental disorder diagnosis. </p>



<p>What's more, only
about half of those with PTSD symptoms seek help. Many servicemen and women
aren't comfortable seeking treatment for fear of the stigma which can be
attached to them should they seek assistance. </p>



<p>“I am an American
Soldier and I have PTSD,” Chaplain Major Carlos Huerta wrote on the Army's
official website in 2012, “I refused to admit to myself even when the Army
doctors told me I had it in 2004. I refused to talk to anyone about it even
when Army health professionals told me I needed to in 2005. I was afraid how
Army leadership would react if I had that on my record. I was Soldier, I was
tough...” </p>



<p>It was only after
an episode in 2010, during which he feared for his life, that he sought help. </p>



<p>“I don't know what
the trigger was, but it hit me hard... All of a sudden, I felt a tightness in
my chest, it was hard to breathe, I felt closed in and panicky. I bolted out of
bed thinking I was dying... The morning came and it hit again, a panic, a fear
of being closed off, claustrophobia, and pains in the chest. I thought maybe I
was having a heart attack and, if I was, I needed to see a doctor. A heart
attack was honorable, PTSD was not,” he wrote. </p>



<p><b>Backlogged </p></b>



<p>Even those who do
seek immediate help often have trouble getting the assistance they require.
Currently, the VA has a total of 793,211 pending claims (as of July 20), of
which 515,012 are considered “backlogged”, meaning they've been in the system
for more than 125 days with no decision made.  Moreover, as of December 2012,
245,000 veterans had waited a year or more to receive their benefits with an
average waiting time of 273 days, according to the Center for Investigative
Reporting. </p>



<p>“It shouldn't be
hard for someone who served their country honorably to get medical care,” Paul
Riekhoff told PBS. Riekhoff founded Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America in
2004 after serving in Iraq. </p>



<p>A large portion of
the problem centers around two fundamental issues: the medical databases used
by the Department of Defense (DOD) and the VA are different and therefore
cannot communicate with one another, and most claims with the VA are still
filed one paper – 97 percent, according to Riekhoff. There are so many paper
claims, in fact, that a report from NBC's Rebecca Ruiz found that at the VA
office in Winston-Salem the tremendous weight of the physical volumes
threatened the structural integrity of an entire floor. </p>



<p>“The excess weight
of the stored files has the potential to compromise the structural integrity of
the sixth floor of the facility... We noticed floors bowing under the excess
weight to the extent that the tops of the file cabinets were noticeably unlevel
throughout the storage area,” the VA office of the Inspector General's report
stated. </p>



<p>This is especially
problematic for those veterans suffering from the PTSD as a 270 page study in
2005 found early intervention to be especially key in the management of PTSD. </p>



<p>“In their acute
presentation of these symptoms, which include subsets of a large variety of
affective, cognitive, perceptional, emotional and behavioral responses which
are relatively normal responses to gross psychological trauma. If persistent,
however, they develop a life of their own and... Early intervention  and later
avoidance of positive reinforcement for such symptoms is a critical preventive
measure,” the study by Dr. Albert Glass and Dr. Franklin Jones stated. </p>



<p>These delays in
treatment have had devastating consequences for veterans and contribute to the
fact that all veterans are more than three times more likely to commit suicide.
In 2009, it was estimated that 6,000 veterans took their own lives. </p>



<p>VA officials
continue to insist that they are working tirelessly to solve the problems
presented by the Backlog. VA Secretary Eric Shinseki says the department aims
to eliminate it entirely by 2015. </p>



<p>“We've said all
along it would take time to solve this correctly,” Shinseki told Stars and
Stripes, “And we are are not going to leave this for another secretary and
president to wrestle with. We are on track to eliminate the backlog in 2015. We
started out four years ago with a plan, and we've stayed with it.” </p>



<p>Still, that's two
years away, and many veterans already struggle getting the benefits that are
their right. </p>



<p>“There's
unfortunately a running joke that if you don't have PTSD by the time you get to
the VA, you'll have it by the time you leave,” Riekhoff said. </p>



<p><b>'We simply do
not accept those excuses'</b></p>


<p>Picking up on the
failings of the VA, and government as a whole, several private non-profits have
stepped in to help mentally and physically wounded veterans find purpose on
their return stateside. Many of these organizations focus on community service
as a means to help veterans deal with the stresses they've returned with from
abroad. </p>



<p>“Service can help
focus veterans, help them to find a career path and use their educational
benefits under the GI bill wisely... Imagine the impact that 100,000 veterans
spending a year in public service back home would have,” Ken Harbaugh of
ServiceNation, an organization which works to expand service opportunities for
those who wish to take advantage of them, told Time magazine.</p>



<p>Eric Greitens, a
former Navy SEAL, founded the Mission Continues in 2007 with his own combat
pay, and the disability checks from two friends. Mission Continues places
post-9/11 veterans in six-month service fellowships within their community. To
date, the organization has placed over 700 veterans in fellowships. Mission
Continues works to be a different kind of non-profit for vets, and contrasts
with the more traditional veterans charities. Greitens believes that Mission
Continues' service-oriented attitude is the best way to help struggling
veterans. </p>



<p>“People understand
the tremendous sacrifices that veterans have made, and they instinctively want
to do something for them... That sometimes leads people to give veterans an
excuse: Oh, you didn't show up for work on time. It must be that you have
Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. Oh, you're disabled, don't even try. Or, you're
being a bad partner to your husband or wife, or a bad father or mother. It must
be that you lost a bunch of friends. We simply do not accept those excuses,”
Greitens told Time. </p>



<p>Mission Continues
works to instill the sense that the vets who work with the organization are
still needed, and Greitens ultimate goal is that the men and women whom he
works with will become community leaders. </p>



<p>Several other
programs work to help veterans through community service including Team
Rubicon, The Wounded Warrior Project, among others. </p>

<p>“You're going to
spend as much time coming back from the war as you spent in the war,” Iraq
veteran Michael Zacchea said. </p>
