<p>November 16 marks the forty-first year since leaked
government documents led the press to report on a study of 400 syphilitic
sharecroppers in Macon County, Alabama, and brought 40 years of mistreatment to
a close. </p>



<p>The Tuskegee Syphilis Study originated in 1932 as a
collaboration between the Tuskegee Institute (now Tuskegee University) and the
United States Public Health Service (PHS) to study the natural progression of
untreated syphilis in black men – at the time it was assumed the disease's
progression was tied to the carrier's race. The study was seen as a follow up
to a Norwegian study from 1928 on the effects of untreated syphilis on white
men. </p>



<p>At the study's start, the most effective methods for
treating Syphilis were Salvarsan, ointments of mercury, and bismuth, but these
treatments were ineffective at best, and harmful at worst as they were highly
toxic to both bacteria and their human host. </p>



<p>With that in mind, researchers justified recruiting 399
syphilitic men from Macon (as well as about 200 without the disease to act as a
control group) to observe as the disease progressed without treatment because
there was no suitable treatment to begin with – they decided that they were
doing no further harm than the disease itself. </p>



<p>However, ethical considerations rapidly deteriorated, and it
wasn't long before those participating in the study were being deceived by
those conducting it. For instance, to ensure men would come for potentially
dangerous or painful diagnostic spinal taps, researchers mailed the 400
syphilitic men a letter titled “Last Chance for Special Free Treatment”, even
though the procedures that were to be performed were non-therapeutic and would
have no bearing on any of the subject's potential recovery. </p>



<p>By the 1940s, scientists discovered that penicillin was a
safe, and effective treatment for the disease, and during World War II, 250 of
the 399 subjects registered for the draft and were consequently diagnosed by
the military as having Syphilis – to then, researchers had not told the men of
their disease – and were ordered to obtain treatment before they could be
inducted into the armed services. Public Health Service researchers tried to
prevent the men from receiving proper treatment by administering placebos which
the researchers said were a cure for their “bad blood” – a term used
colloquially in the region to describe myriad diseases. </p>



<p>“The longer the study, the better the ultimate information
we would derive,” Doctor John Heller, a PHS researcher, told author James
Jones. Jones further commented on this, stating that to PHS researchers, “the
men's status did not warrant ethical debate. They were subjects, not patients;
clinical material, not sick people.” </p>



<p>Though the study was never considered “secret” by the Public
Health Service or Tuskegee, which provided human and capital resources for it,
the full details of its methodology were not made public until 1972 when the
Washington Star reported on it from documents leaked by Peter Buxtun, a
venereal disease researcher for the Public Health Service. </p>



<p>Buxton had tried repeatedly in the late 1960s to bring his
concerns over the study's dubious methodology to Public Health Service
leadership, but instead of discontinuing the study, the PHS instead sought the
support of the local chapter of the American Medical Association and National
Medical Association to assuage his concerns. They did not.</p>



<p>The New York Times ran a front page story on the study a day
following the Star's report, and the public outcry prompted congressional
hearings and governmental reviews which eventually led the study's termination,
Nov. 16, 1972.  </p>



<p>By that point, 28 men, of the original 399, died of
syphilis, another 100 died of syphilis-related complications, and 40 of their
wives and 19 of their children contracted syphilis. </p>



<p>The US government paid $9 million to surviving study
participants and their families as part of a settlement agreement to end a
class action lawsuit filed by the NAACP on behalf of the study's subjects and
their families. The government also agreed to provide free medical care to
surviving participants and their family members who contracted syphilis as a
result of the study. </p>



<p>In 1974, in reaction to the study, congress passed the
National Research Act which greatly tightened regulations regarding medical
experimentation and study involving human subjects. President Bill Clinton
issued a formal apology on behalf of the government in 1997 for the abuses
exacted on the study's subjects by the United States. </p>

<p>However, for many, particularly in the African American, the fear created by
the study remains, and African Americans remain less likely to participate in
medical studies than other racial groups.  </p>
