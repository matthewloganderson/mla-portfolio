<p>Nearly one million Americans reside in one of roughly 39,000 Assisted Living Facilities. Yet, many remain woefully unaware of what differentiates these facilities from Skilled Nursing Homes -- even the Federal Government has made no decisions in this regard, and the multi-billion dollar industry remains unregulated at the national level. Which means that states are left to their own devices, and potential residents to theirs, in determining what constitutes adequate care for some of America's most vulnerable citizens: the elderly.</p>   
 
<p>Finding the Care You Need</p>
 
<p>Making the decision to place yourself or a loved one in either a nursing home or assisted living facility is a wrenching one. Often these facilities are a last resort for families who cannot provide the care their loved ones require. While the perception among many families seems to be that nursing homes and assisted living facilities provide more or less the same care, that is far from true.</p> 
 
<p>A nursing home "provides residents with a room, meals, personal care, nursing care, and medical services. Nursing homes provide care to residents with chronic conditions requiring long-term care... Typically, patients in long-term care facilities require assistance with multiple activities of daily living (ADLs), which include bathing, dressing, eating, toileting, transferring in and out of chairs or beds, and continence, and/or have cognitive limitations due to Alzheimer's disease or another form of dementia," MetLife's Mature Market Institute study on long-term care costs stated.</p> 
 
<p>Assisted Living Facilities, by contrast, are generally reserved for individuals unable to live at home, but who do not require the kind of skilled, 24/7 care and oversight found in nursing homes. Assisted Living typically provides for some assistance with ADLs and chores, and about half of Assisted Living facilities provide for the care of those suffering from Alzheimer's or dementia, according to the MetLife study, and of those which do offer Alzheimer's or dementia care 61 percent charge an additional fee.</p>

<p>Often, if it is the family of a person choosing whether to put the family member in a facility, the initial urge is to keep their loved one as far from a nursing home as possible. However, despite their seemingly poor reputation, there are many elderly who belong in nursing homes for the simple reason that Assisted Living cannot provide the level of medical care these individuals require.</p> 
 
<p>"'Good nursing home' is not a contradiction, by the way, despite the industry's longstanding and well-documented problems... There are good ones and there are seniors who need them," New York Times' writer Paula Span wrote in 2011. The primary factor which allows nursing homes to provide more constant care is their higher staff to patient ratio, the report stated.</p> 
 
<p>Getting the Care You Need</p>
 
<p>If, after doing preliminary research, you decide that you or your loved one belong in an Assisted Living Facility, it is important to further investigate your assisted living options within your desired area. Somewhat problematically, the under regulation of this industry at the federal level created a dizzying array of facilities which qualify as "Assisted Living Facilities" in some states, but not in others, and with monthly costs spanning from an average base rate of $2,355 in Arkansas to an average monthly base rate of $5,933 in Washington D.C.</p> 
 
<p>"Assisted Living can <be> expensive, and because it is not covered by Medicare; for many seniors the cost can be prohibitive," a Propublica report published last month stated.</p> 
 
<p>And as high as base rates for these facilities can run, they often do not account for all of the services needed by the resident. These services can add thousands of dollars to a resident's monthly tab. For example, if not included in the base rate, bathing assistance carries an average monthly fee of $181; for dressing assistance: $236; medication management: $347, according to the MetLife study.</p> 
 
<p>"Consumers... should consider carefully when making comparisons, and be especially mindful to gather information about services included in the monthly base cost and the cost of services not included," the study states. "When faced with paying thousands of dollars each month for care which will not be covered by Medicare, even a few dollars in lowered cost is attractive. However, it is in their best interest to make comparisons on total potential costs for equivalent levels of service, and not simply on monthly base rates."</p>
 
<p>Finding the Environment You Need</p>
 
<p>Assisted Living Facilities, like restaurants, vary widely in the level of professionalism and service offered by their staff. For instance, only 54.5 percent of Assisted Living facilities have a registered nurse or licensed practical nurse on staff, according to a study from Johns Hopkins University.</p> 
 
<p>Additionally, because of the dearth of regulation surrounding the industry, it falls to consumers to do the bulk of the research required before committing a loved one and thousands of dollars every month to a relatively mysterious facility.</p> 
 
<p>"About 82 percent of residential care facilities <Assisted Living Facilities> are private, for-profit facilities... with about four in 10 belonging to a national chain. Such for-profit chains... often have a requirements for a return on revenue that means they're always pressing for higher occupancy and for constraining variable costs, and variable costs are staffing and food, and to some degree, activities," the ProPublica report stated, "That doesn't necessarily mean that you should dismiss for-profits and focus your search on non-profits only... there are good and bad facilities in each category."</p> 
 
<p>That said, while statistics and information on Assisted Living Facilities are rarer than their Nursing Home counter parts, information on complaints and sanctions levied against licensed facilities can be found at your states Office of Long-Term Care Ombudsman (for information on your specific state's office can be found <link=http://www.ltcombudsman.org/ombudsman>here</link>.).</p> 
 
<p>In all, research is a consumer's best asset in their search for an Assisted Living Facility. The following is a cursory list of questions you should answer before committing to any particular facility (a more exhaustive list can be found <link=http://assets.aarp.org/external_sites/caregiving/checklists/checklist_assistedLiving.html>here</link>):</p>
 
<p>1.) Have you visited the facility more than once? With and without sales staff? Unannounced?</p>
<p>2.) What services are covered in the base rate? What is the cost of any additional services you require?</p> 
<p>3.) What is the staff to resident ratio? Are trained medical staff on site? If so, how often? How is the facility staffed throughout the day (does it differ from day to night shifts)?</p> 
<p>4.) What activities for residents does the facility offer, and how often do these activities take place?</p> 
<p>5.) What kind of contract is required upon move in?</p> 
<p>6.) Will insurance cover any or all of the cost?</p> 
<p>7.) How are non-skilled staff trained? How often are they trained, and in what areas? How are the staff selected and screened?</p> 
<p>8.) Does the facility prepare a written plan describing how it will care for you or your loved one? How is that plan written and by whom?</p> 
<p>9.) What is the facilities record of abuses and sanctions from the state? Has the facility been cited for inadequate training or medication administration violations? How often?</p> 
<p>10.) Would you want to live here?</p>
