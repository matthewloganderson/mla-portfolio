export default `<p>Health-policy reform has walked a tempestuous path in the
United States, yet relatively little has been accomplished in the century
since progressive supporters of President Theodore Roosevelt called for a kind
of universal healthcare in 1912. Vocal opposition from conservative leaders and
many trade groups, most notably the American Medical Association, marred this
path at every opportunity. </p>
<p >That President Obama's signature piece of
legislation, The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (ACA),
passed at all is rather remarkable. Some commentators argue that the law
doesn't go far enough in its reforms and regulations, and they may well be
right. But for all its flaws, the Affordable Care Act is, in the end, better
than the alternative: nothing. </p>
<p >“There are still millions of people out there not only who
want to get health insurance, but many who have health insurance who deserve a
better deal, and deserve the kind of savings that the Affordable Care Act will
offer,” the President said in a July press conference. “Last year alone,
Americans saved $3.4 billion on premiums.” </p>
<p >The Affordable Care Act was written such that its provisions
will go into effect in phases. Some took effect when the law was enacted, or
later in 2010, such as a provision which prevents insurers from dropping
individuals once they become ill or another which allows dependents to remain
on their parents' insurance plans until their 26th birthday regardless of
marital status, employment, or whether the dependent is still in school. Other
large portions of the law were implemented between 2011 and 2012. The law is
set to be fully implemented by 2020. </p>
<p >“The American people deserve a fair shot. They expect
businesses to play by a fair set of rules. That's why this fight is so
important,” Obama said at the same press conference, “Our broken healthcare
system threatened the hopes and the dreams of families and businesses across
the country who feared that one illness or one accident could cost them
everything they spent a lifetime building. And, step by step, we're fixing that
system.” </p>
<p >Beginning Oct. 1, one of the signature pieces of the law is
scheduled to take effect: state-based insurance exchanges will begin enrolling
individuals in insurance plans, which are are subsidized through federal tax
credits for individuals and families meeting certain income requirements. These
exchanges are meant to create competition for private insurance plans thereby
keeping premiums lower. </p>
<p >“New online marketplaces will allow consumers to go online
to compare healthcare prices... You're going to see competition like we haven't
seen before. Insurance companies are going to have to compete for your
business,” President Obama said, “Now, if you're one of the 85 percent of
Americans who already have insurance... you already have an array of new
benefits in place, you don't have to wait until Oct. 1. You're already getting
benefits even if you don't know it's because of the Affordable Care Act. You're
getting better protections. You're getting more value for each dollar you spend
on your healthcare.” </p>`
