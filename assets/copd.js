<p>Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, or COPD as it's known
more colloquially, costs the United States nearly $50 billion dollars every
year, and represents a full three percent of all healthcare costs incurred in
Europe. The condition -- which primarily affects smokers, and causes severe
shortness of breath, persistent coughing, and increased mucus production -- is
not itself a disease. Rather, COPD describes a confluence of diseases which
together cause the symptoms listed above. </p>



<p>“Many people mistake their increased breathlessness and
coughing as a normal part of aging. In the early stages of the disease, you may
not notice the symptoms,” the COPD Foundation states on its website. “COPD can
develop for years without noticeable shortness of breath. You begin to see the
symptoms in more developed stages of the disease. That's why it is important
that you talk to your doctor as soon as you notice any symptoms... Ask your
doctor about taking a spirometry test.” </p>



<p>COPD is most often diagnosed using spirometry, which means
“measuring of breath”. A Spirometer measures the amount of air and the speed at
which it travels to deduce a measure called the “Forced Expiratory Volume”. 
Generally, if the patient is over 35 years of age, complains of shortness of
breath, chronic coughing, frequent winter colds, and has a history of smoking
(or other risk factors), an FEV of less than 70 percent of expected confirms a
COPD diagnosis. </p>



<p>“I began to have spells when I couldn't catch my breath
while doing the simplest of activities. I was extremely short of breath most of
the time...” wrote Susie Bowers for the COPD International Support Network.
“Following a battery of tests including spirometry... my family doctor said,
'it's bad, very, very bad.'... At age 54, I had end-stage COPD caused by more
than 30 years of smoking.” </p>



<p>Physicians and pulmonary specialists use spirometry as both
a means of diagnosis and as a way to determine the severity of COPD,
classifying the condition on a scale from “Mild”, an FEV of greater than 80 percent
of expected, to “Very Severe” which indicates an FEV of less than thirty
percent of expected and  is considered respiratory failure. </p>



<p>“As so many go undiagnosed, bringing awareness to early
diagnosis and slowing progression is key. Hiding one's head in the sand serves
only to worsen the condition. It can be treated, and with some personal
changes, a person can live a full life, even if it means doing things a bit
differently,” Judy, an associate of the COPD foundation wrote. </p>



<p>A major factor which differentiates COPD from other
respiratory illness is the lack of a cure. COPD is considered a progressive
disease which cannot be reversed, only managed. The two most tried and true
methods of management include the cessation of smoking (which decreases the
likelihood of COPD-related death by 18 percent) and supplemental oxygen intake,
but other methods include annual influenza vaccination, pneumococcal
vaccinations every five years, and pulmonary rehabilitation – a program of
exercise and counseling designed to benefit the patient's well being. </p>



<p>“While a cure is optimistic, COPD can be slowed in
progression by attention to nutrition, and proper exercise... difficulty
breathing burns more calories, so a diet of lean protein, and a good mixture of
grains, fruites, and vegetables are vital,” wrote the associate of the COPD
Foundation.  </p>



<p>In the United States, 12 million individuals are diagnosed
as having COPD, and some estimates place the number of undiagnosed cases at
near 12 million, as well. COPD is the third leading cause of death in the US,
following heart disease and cancer. </p>



<p>November is COPD awareness month, and Nov. 20 is COPD
awareness day.</p>
