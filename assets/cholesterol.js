<p>Cardiovascular disease kills more people in the United
States than anything else. It accounted for 24.2 percent of all deaths in 2010,
according the Centers for Disease Control. </p>



<p>Heart disease stems from a number of issues, but one of the
most common is high cholesterol. In the US, one in three suffer from high
cholesterol, an affliction which can ultimately lead to heart attacks, strokes,
and other vascular diseases. </p>



<p>That said, cholesterol is vital to cardiovascular health. In
fact, our bodies even produce it naturally.</p>



<p>“While too much cholesterol can be harmful, just the right
amount of it does a lot of important work in the body. But like carbohydrates
in recent years, cholesterol has gotten such a bad rap that most people don't
know the good it does,” writes Doctor Mason Freeman for Harvard Medical School.
</p>



<p>Cholesterol, among other substances, compose the outer
coating of our cells, makes up the acids in our stomach which allow for
digestion, and facilitates our body's ability to make Vitamin D and hormones
such as estrogen and testosterone. </p>



<p>Two types of cholesterol are found within our bodies: HDL
(good) and LDL (bad). While HDL is comprised mostly of proteins, LDL is made up
mostly of fats. Most people suffering from high cholesterol have too much LDL
and not enough HDL. The build up of LDL within arteries leads to
atherosclerosis, a narrowing and hardening of the arteries which inhibits
healthy blood flow to the brain and other vital organs. </p>



<p>“In most people, 60 to 70 percent of cholesterol is carried
in LDL particles. LDL particles act as ferries, taking cholesterol to the parts
of the body that need it at any given time. Unfortunately, if you have too much
LDL... it deposits the cholesterol into the arteries,” Freeman wrote. “HDL is
bacially the opposite of LDL. Instead of having a lot of fat, HDL has a lot of
protein. Instead of ferrying cholesterol around the body, HDL acts as a vacuum
cleaning sucking up as much excess cholesterol as it can.”</p>



<p><b>Controlling Your Cholesterol</b></p>

<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p>Several factors contribute to the level of cholesterol
within our blood, most notably: diet and exercise. Foods high in saturated fats
tend to raise LDL levels, while foods low in fat reduce the amount of LDL in
the blood. </p>



<p>“Lifestyle changes affect HDL levels – exercise can increase
them while obesity and smoking lower them. As for diet, in general, the
high-fat dits that raise LDL also raise HDL, while low-fat diets lower both.
However, by carefully choosing the right foods, you can eat a diet that lowers
LDL without lowering HDL,” Freeman wrote. </p>



<p>Some foods which can aid in the regulation of HDL/LDL levels
include: </p>



<p style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in'>1.)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Oats: the soluble
fiber found in oats binds cholesterol in the digestive system and prevents them
from ever entering the circulatory system.</p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in'>2.)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Whole Grains: Like
oats, whole grains reduce LDL levels via soluble fiber. </p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in'>3.)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Beans: Also rich in
fiber, but because beans take longer for the body to digest than other foods,
you feel full longer which prevents the ingestion of other, potentially fatty
foods. </p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in'>4.)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Apples, grapes,
strawberries, citrus fruits: Rich in pectin, a soluble fiber that lowers LDL. </p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in'>5.)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Soy: Consuming 25
grams of soy each day can lower LDL by five to six percent. </p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in'>6.)Fatty fish:
The Omega 3 fats found within fish work to lower LDL, and act as a supplement
to LDL boosting saturated fats. </p>
