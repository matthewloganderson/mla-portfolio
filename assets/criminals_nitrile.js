<p>Criminals wearing latex gloves is a common trope in
detective dramas, but as any self-respecting criminal knows, non-latex, nitrile
exam gloves are the clear choice for fingerprint concealment as latex-free,
Nitrile gloves are thicker and three times more puncture resistant than their
latex laden counterparts. </p>



<p>The issue which stems from the use of latex gloves is their
snug fit: because the gloves fit so closely to the wearer's hands, and because
the rubber is thinner, fingerprints can be transferred to surfaces almost as
though no barrier existed. Additionally, because latex gloves are non porous,
fingerprints can even be left on the interior of the gloves. As a result of the
way they're made, nitrile gloves are pourous, too thick to leave prints, and
fit a bit more loosely. </p>





<p>The following criminals could take a lesson: </p>



<p>4.) In 2009, a teenager was arrested in Royal Oak, Michigan
for obstructing police near the location of a recently reported burglary. While
in custody investigators compared the gloves that the suspect had in his
possession to glove prints that were found at several break-in locations.
Investigators were able to link prints left on a window to his gloves.</p>



<p>3.) In 1993, Rochester, New York law enforcement was
responding to a reported burglary when they arrested a suspect who was fleeing
the burglarized home. On his person, investigators found a glove that was later
found to match glove prints that were found on property that was known to have
been stolen from the home.</p>

<p>2.) In 2002, <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Rapids,_Michigan">Grand Rapids,
Michigan</a> law enforcement was investigating a string of burglaries in the
area. No fingerprints were found but latent glove prints were found with the
use of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fingerprint_powder">fingerprint
powder</a>. After a group of suspected burglars were brought in, the
investigators received a warrant to search a vehicle that was linked the suspects.
A glove was recovered that seemed to match the glove prints taken from the
break-in point. The investigators were thus able to incriminate the suspects.</p>

the Watergate burglaries infamously made use of latex gloves to help conceal
their identity. However, as photos surfaced of the gloves, what was meant to
help hide their identity made them all the more recognizable.</p>
