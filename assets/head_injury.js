<p>Football is, by far, America's most popular sport. You need
look no further than the high ratings and enormous advertising revenue the
Superbowl garners each year to see that. Having said that, football is an
inherently violent sport, and it doesn't take a genius to notice that the
trauma endemic to the game might have longer-lasting consequences to players
than those viewers see on television or in the stadium. </p>


<p>But that is a notion that has either escaped the NFL until
recent years, or a problem they've deliberately ignored until now, according to
a new Frontline documentary called “League of Denial”. </p>


<p>In particular, the Frontline documentary was concerned with
long-term brain damage caused by the head trauma football players regularly
sustain during games. Frontline's piece, based on a book of the same title by
reporters Mark and Steve Fainaru, focused on the ways in which outside experts
studying the effects of trauma on NFL players tried to inform the League, and
the ways in which the League seemingly dismissed as non-conclusive, at best, or
tried to cover up, at worst, this information. </p>


<p>The problem of concussions for NFL players is one that has
been discussed since the '90s, but up to quite recently a problem the League
has been less than willing to acknowledge or discuss. The death and autopsy of
a former Pittsburgh Steeler, Mike Webster, who died in 2002 at the age of 50
sparked the conversation happening today. </p>


<p>“His body [Webster's] ends up in the Allegheny County
coroner's office... And there's a young, junior pathologist there named Bennet
Omalu. He makes this decision sort of on the spur of the moment to study Mike
Webster's brain,” Mark Fainaru told NPR. </p>


<p>Omalu, a neuropathologist, found Webster suffered from
Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE). The disease is degenerative, and
researchers have identified four stages. At first, there are no external or
behavioral symptoms present, however, CTE causes a protein called Tau to form
around blood vessels in the brain which interrupts and later kills nerve
cells.  </p>


<p>“When I opened up his skull, I had a mental picture of what
his brain would look like based on my education,” Omalu said in the PBS
documentary. “I saw abnormal proteins in his brain... After I looked at it over
and over and over, I was convinced this was something, I said, 'Okay, it's
something...'”</p>


<p>As the Tau affects more and more nerve cells, it spreads
through out the frontal, and temporal lobes of the brain. Eventually, the
condition affects the amygdala and hippocampus which impairs emotion and
memory. In its late stage, CTE overwhelms the brain, killing countless nerve
cells, and shrinking the organ by roughly half its size. At this stage, the
brain is deformed and brittle, and cognitive function is extremely limited. </p>


<p>“He would forget which way the grocery store was, which way
to get home, he broke down in tears in front of me a couple times because he
couldn't get his thoughts together, he couldn't keep them in order,” Colin
Webster, Mike Webster's son, told Frontline. “I'd come outside sometimes, and
just see him sitting in the truck, it would be freezing, and he'd just be
sitting there looking miserable. He said, 'Well the worst thing is I'm getting
to the point where sometimes or if I don't have my medicine, I'm cold and I don't
realize that I can fix it by putting a jacket on.'” </p>


<p>In 1997, Webster contacted attorney Bob Fitzsimmons to file
a disability claim which alleged that he sustained permanent injuries as a
result of his 17 years with the Steelers. In the course of reviewing Webster's
claim, the NFL hired a physician to examine Webster -- the NFL's doctor
concurred with Webster's disability claim, and found that his cognitive
impairment was a result of his 17-year career in professional football. The NFL
granted Webster monthly disability payments, and acknowledged, for the first
time ever, that his injuries were a result of the sport. That report, however,
was not made public. </p>


<p>“I was excited. I thought the football industry would be
happy with our new discovery. I thought naively that discovery of new
information, unraveling new information, redefining concepts, I thought the
football industry would embrace it... They didn't do that. Even with respect to
today, they have not done that... the intent was to delegitmize it,” Omalu
said. </p>


<p>The NFL called for Omalu to retract a paper he'd published
on the CTE, calling it fraud. When Omalu refused, the NFL published papers of
their own. </p>


<p>“This is a $10 billion industry, right? And it's hard to
imagine that the NFL goes away... It's a collision sport whose violence is
loved by all of us who love the game. There's a powerful point in the book
where Bennet Omalu -- the scientist we described who first sees CTE in a
football player -- is showing his slides and his findings to a doctor who is
connected to the NFL, and the doctor says something like, 'If 10 percent of
mothers come to belive that football is dangerous -- to the point of brain
damage, effecively -- that's the end of football as we know it.' I think we are
at that point now, not necessarily where it's the end of football, but where
there's a dialogue beginning about whether you want to let your kids play or
not.” </p>


<p>In September, threatened with a class-action lawsuit over
the injuries 4500 retired players sustained during their careers, the NFL
settled with the plaintiffs for $765 million, but admitted to no wrong doing.
If split evenly, the settlement amounts to about $170,000 per player. Today,
the average NFL player makes roughly $2 million each year. </p>
