<p>Amid a bitter fight in congress over the roll out of the
Affordable Care Act which led to a partial government shutdown, the law's
centerpiece health insurance exchanges opened for the public Tuesday, Oct. 1. </p>



<p>The deployment of the exchanges did not go off without
issues, however. More than 2.8 million visitors to healthcare.gov, the
federally-managed health insurance exchange, between midnight and late
afternoon brought page-load times to a crawl. Several states had similar
issues: California, for instance, yielded five million page views by 3 p.m.
According to the Wall Street Journal. </p>



<p>“That gives you a sense of how important this is to millions
of Americans across the country... And we're going to be speeding things up in
the next few hours to handle all of this demand that exceeds anything that we
had expected,” President Obama said Tuesday. </p>



<p>The heavy traffic put particular pressure on the federal
page, which runs the health insurance exchanges for 34 states. Healthcare.gov
garnered 4.7 million unique visitors in the first 24 hours, according to the
New York Times – many times the highest number of visitors other
federally-operated web pages, like Medicare, have experienced. Government
officials said the unusually high traffic created problems in viewing and
enrolling in insurance plans. </p>



<p>“Like every new law, every new product roll-out, there are
going to be some glitches in the sign-up process along the way that we will
fix. I've been saying that from the start,” said Obama, Tuesday. “Consider that
just a couple of weeks ago, Apple rolled out a new mobile operating system, and
within days, they found a glitch, so they fixed it. I don't remember anybody
suggesting Apple should stop selling iPhones or iPads or threatening to shut
down the company if they didn't. That's not how we do things in America.... We
get to work, we make things happen, we make them better, we keep going.”  </p>



<p>The immense traffic which the state and federal exchanges
fielded again illuminated the overwhelming demand for affordable health
coverage. Studies show as many as 15 percent, or 50 million Americans, are
without health insurance. </p>



<p>The exchanges are meant to offer consumers more transparency
and affordability in their search by displaying  comparisons between exchange
prices and those through more traditional, larger carriers like Aetna Inc. or
Cigna Corp. and by offering significant tax relief to many individuals who
purchase their coverage through the exchanges. </p>



<p>“You'll find more choices, more competition, and in may
cases, lower prices. Most uninsured Americans will find that they can get
covered for $100 or less. And you don't have to take my word for it, go on the
website, healthcare.gov, check it out for yourself,” Obama said. “This law
doesn't just mean economic security for our families; it means we're finally
addressing the biggest drivers of our long-term deficits. It means a stronger
economy.”  </p>



<p>That said, premiums won't go down for everyone. Because of
the way the exchanges work to keep prices down, by more evenly distributing the
cost and risk across those insured through the exchanges, premiums tend to be
lower than previous plans for older, less healthy Americans and higher for
younger, healthier Americans. </p>
