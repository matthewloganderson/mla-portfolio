<p>A key component of the Affordable Care Act was the establishment of Value-Based Purchasing, which  
rewards or penalizes facilities that receive Medicare and Medicaid payments based on certain performance  
metrics like Prevention Quality Indicators and Patient Safety Indicators which examine readmission rates and 
 
Healthcare-Acquired Infection (HAI) rates to determine payment schedules for facilities.</p>
<br><p>HAIs represent nearly 10 percent of inpatient costs in the United States, and are one of the Affordable  
Care Act's top priorities. Surgical Site Infections account for nearly 20 percent of all HAIs, and since HAI 
 
rates alone can reduce government payments to hospitals for Medicare patients by up to 3 percent, it is  
imperative that caregivers have access to the products and information needed to keep themselves and  
patients safe, while saving hospitals and taxpayers money.</p>

<br><p><strong>Operating Room Environment</strong></p>
<p>Operating rooms are perhaps the most infection-sensitive environment within a facility, and since  
surgical procedures, by their very nature, increase the likelihood of infection contraction, it is  
imperative to keep them as hygienic and sanitized as possible. In the U.S. <a href="http://www.quickmedical.com/operating-room.html">operating room's 
</a> environmental surfaces have been implicated as a potential source of SSIs. It is important to  
routinely reestablish a clean environment after procedures by using an <a href="http://www.quickmedical.com/surgical-scientific-hard-surface-cleaner.html">EPA-approved hospital 
 
disinfectant</a> to decontaminate soiled or unclean areas. Since inadequate sterilization of surgical  
instruments can result in SSIs, it is crucial to sterilize instruments using approved methods (steam  
under pressure, dry heat, etc.). Regular cleaning and maintenance is necessary to ensure antimicrobial  
efficacy.</p>
<p><strong>Surgical Attire & Draping</strong></p>
<p>Surgical attire refers both to the sterile and non-sterile items donned by team members including scrub  
suits, bouffants or caps, shoe covers, masks, <a href="http://www.quickmedical.com/surgical-gloves.html">gloves</a>, and gowns. Use of such  
barriers minimizes a patient's exposure to microbes from the surgical team and vice versa. Sterile surgical  
gowns and gloves should be worn during any surgical procedure, and sterile drapes used to isolate the  
incision site. Gowns should be impermeable to liquids and viruses, and gloves should only be donned after  
gowns.</p> 
<p><strong>Asepsis & Surgical Technique</strong></p>
<p>Excellent surgical technique and rigorous adherence to asepsis principles by all scrubbed personnel is  
the foundation of SSI prevention. Even unscrubbed personnel (such as anesthesiologist) should strictly abide 
 
by established guidelines. Care must be taken to ensure the principles of asepsis are adhered to for any  
task within the <a href="http://www.quickmedical.com/operating-room.html">operating room</a>. Unscrubbed personnel have been implicated as the  
source of SSIs after IV or other invasive devices were handled improperly. Excellent surgical technique is  
widely believed to reduce the risk of SSI. Such techniques include maintaining hemostasis, preventing  
hypothermia, gently handling tissues, avoiding accidental entrance into a hollow viscus, and using drains  
and suture material appropriately.</p>
