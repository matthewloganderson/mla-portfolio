<p>Antibiotics have been heralded as a miracle drug since
Alexander Fleming discovered Penicillin in 1928. Most often, these drugs are
the thing people seek when they visit the doctor for a runny nose, or a sore
throat, and they are one of the fundamental blocks upon which modern medicine
is built. </p>



<p>What happens, then, when that block begins to crumble? </p>



<p>Drug-Resistant Bacteria are those which have developed an
immunity to one or more antibiotics. Perhaps the most famous of them is a type
of staph infection called MRSA, although this resistant strain of staph
certainly is not the only example. </p>



<p>Two million Americans each year sustain an illness as a
result of one of the 17 drug-resistant strains the CDC identified in a report
the organization released last week; of those two million, 23,000 die from
their disease. </p>



<p>Those numbers, however, could be much higher. “This is a
floor,” Dr. Steven Solomon of the CDC told The New York Times, “We wanted the
cleanest number, the least subjective number.” </p>



<p>The researchers tasked with compiling this data were
instructed to base the figures on deaths that resulted directly from a
drug-resistant bacterial infection, not those cases in which a drug-resistant
infection was a factor, but perhaps was not the direct cause of death. </p>



<p>“They have come up with hard numbers where it has been only
guesswork... This sets a baseline we can all believe in,” said Dr. Stuart Levy,
president of the Alliance for the Prudent Use of Antibiotics. </p>



<p>When antibacterials were introduced and gained widespread
acceptance around the end of World War II, they were responsible for the near
eradication or neutralization of many of the world's most dangerous infections
– Syphilis, Typhoid, E-Coli, and Staph to name a few. </p>



<p>Drugs like penicillin and  others, when introduced into our
bodies, would kill all or most of bacteria comprising the infection, or stop
the bacteria's ability to reproduce. The problem with resistance begins here. </p>



<p>Because antibiotics kill or disable any bacteria too weak to
resist, only the stronger, more virulent versions of common bacteria survive to
reproduce, and after many generations, these stronger bacteria begin to replace
the original, weaker form of the bacteria all together – similar to the manner
in which modern humans replaced the neanderthals who inhabited the earth before
them.  </p>



<p>Researchers have postulated a number of causes for this
resistance. Perhaps the most common of which is the misuse of these drugs and
the prescription of them when they are not needed or beneficial. </p>



<p>In his lecture after winning the 1945 Nobel Prize, Alexander
Fleming warned of this: “The time may come when penicillin can be bought by
anyone in the shops. Then there is the danger that the ignorant man may easily
under dose himself and by exposing his microbes to non-lethal quantities of the
drug make them resistant,” he said, “Here is a hypothetical illustration. Mr. X
has a sore throat. He buys some penicillin and gives himself, not enough to
kill the streptococci, but enough to educate them to resist penicillin. He then
infects his wife. Mrs. X gets pneumonia and is treated with penicillin. As the
streptococci are now resistant to penicillin, the treatment fails. Who is
primarily responsible for Mrs. X's death?” </p>



<p>Now, while one might imagine that these issues are primarily
a result of doctors prescribing antibiotics for viral diseases (upon which
antibiotics have no effect) or patients using them incorrectly, which
accelerates the process of natural selection leaving only resistant bacteria, the
CDC and other researchers have suggested that one of the largest issues
actually traces back creatures one might not expect: farm animals. </p>



<p>Farmers have been feeding sub-therapeutic doses of
antibiotics to livestock since the late 1950s so their animals would grow
larger, faster thus increasing the meat yield of each animal and profits as a
result. Studies find that animals fed antibiotics, on average, grow six percent
larger than those which aren't. </p>



<p>This becomes problematic much in the way Fleming guessed in his
Nobel speech. Because the antibiotics are not administered in a way that
actually kills bacteria, it only serves to bolster the existing bacteria,
making them more difficult to destroy. From there, these resistant strains of
bacteria can be transmitted to humans in three ways: eating contaminated meat,
close contact with animals, or through environmental factors such as via
contaminated manure used to fertilize plants which humans later consume. </p>



<p>The use of antibiotics in farming has steadily increased
since the practice began. It is now the single most common use of antibiotics
worldwide, according to the CDC; in the United States, at least 70 percent of
all antibiotics are used to speed the growth of livestock.</p>



<p>In the past, the development of new antibiotics outpaced the
rate at which bacteria became resistant to them. That however, is no longer the
case: no new class of antibiotics has been discovered since 1987. The problem
is made worse by private sector forces: the development of antibiotics is not
viewed as profitable. </p>



<p>“There are very few antibiotics in the pipeline of big
pharmaceutical companies that develop and make drugs,” Dame Sally Davies told
the BBC in March, “We haven't as a society globally incentivised making
antibiotics. It's quite simple – if they make something to treat high blood
pressure or diabetes and it works, we will use it on our patients everyday.
Whereas antibiotics will only be used for a week or two when they're needed,
and then they have a limited life span because of resistance developing
anyway.” </p>



<p>The implications of drug-resistant bacteria are far
reaching and extend beyond the inability to treat strep throat, or syphilis. If
antibiotics lose their effectiveness, the danger of sustaining a
life-threatening infection from a surgical procedure could become so high as to
prevent doctors from operating because of the danger. It could also prevent the
successful transplant of organs (antibiotics are given to transplantees so the
body won't attack the foreign organ). </p>



<p>“If we're not careful, the medicing chest will be empty when
we go there to look for a live-saving antibiotic... Without urgent action now,
more patients will be thrust back to a time before we had effective drugs,” CDC
director Thomas Frieden told reporters during a press conference. </p>



<p>In its report, the CDC lists four core actions which can
help stop the evolution of regular bacteria into resistant strains: </p>



<p  >1.<span
>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Preventing
Infections, Preventing the Spread of Resistance<br>
“Preventing infections from developing reduces the amount of antibiotics used.
This reduction in antibiotic use, in turn, slows the pace of antibiotic
resistance,” the report stated. </p>

<p  >2.<span
>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Tracking
Resistance Patterns<br>
“CDC gathers data on antibiotic-resistant infections, causes of infections, and
whether there are particular reasons that caused some people to get a resistant
infection. With that information, experts develop specific strategies to
prevent those infections and prevent the resistant bacteria from spreading,”
according to the report. </p>

<p  >3.<span
>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Antibiotic
Stewardship: Improving Prescribing and Use<br>
“Antibiotics are a limited resource. The more that antibiotics are used today,
the less likely they will still be effective in the future. Therefore, doctors
and other health professionals around the world are increasingly adopting the
principles of responsible antibiotic use. Often called antibiotic stewardship.
Effective stewardship ensures that every patient gets the maximum benefit from
the antibiotics, avoids unnecessary harm from allergic reactions and side
effects, and helps preserve the life-saving potential of these drugs for the
future. Efforts to iimprove the responsible use of antibiotics have not only
demonstrated these benefits, but have also been shown to improve outcomes and
save healthcare facilities money in pharmacy costs.”</p>

<p  >4.<span
>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Developing
New Antibiotics and Diagnostic Tests</p>

<p>“Because antibiotic resistance occurs as part of a natural
evolution process, it can be significantly slowed, but not stopped. Therefore,
new antibiotics will always be needed to keep up with resistant bacteria as
well as new diagnostic tests to track the development of resistance.
