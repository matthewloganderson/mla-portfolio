<p>Doctor William Stewart Halsted was a strange, intriguing
man. He was the first doctor to use rubber examination gloves (a precursor to
the preferred, latex-free gloves used today), he pioneered the use of local
anesthetics, he was one of the four founding doctors of Johns Hopkins Hospital,
and he struggled with addictions to cocaine and morphine throughout his adult
life. </p>



<p>Halstead was born to a wealthy New York family in 1852. He
was “the not especially promising son of a wealthy family. A mediocre student,
he wandered through Yale leaving behind no record of ever borrowing a book from
its library,” New York Times reporter Abigail Zuger wrote in 2010. “He chose
medicine not from any affinity for the sick and the suffering (and suffer they
did back then, with filthy hospitals, no antibiotics, and primitive
anesthesia). Rather the cabalistic secrets of the anatomy lab drew him in, and
he fell in love with the complex structures of the body's interior and their
arcane nomenclature.” </p>



<p>After his graduation from Yale College in 1874, Halsted
attended the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, from
whence his received a Doctor of Medicine degree. Halsted worked as a house
physician at New York Hospital afterward, where he would befriend William H.
Welch, another founder of Johns Hopkins Hospital. </p>



<p>From 1878 to 1880 Halsted studied in Austria and Germany
under many prominent surgeons and scientists. Upon returning stateside, he
returned to New York and worked with several area hospitals. In 1882, he
performed one of the first gallbladder procedures in the United States when he
completed a cholescystotomy on his own mother on her kitchen table at 2 a.m.
Additionally, Halsted performed one of the first blood transfusions in the US
when he found his sister dying of blood loss, and transfused his own blood to
save her life. </p>



<p>After reading a report by Karl Koller, an Austrian
Opthalmologist, on the anesthetic effects of  cocaine when it was instilled
into the eye, Halsted realized that cocaine might be used as an effective local
anesthetic. Halsted experimented on himself to learn more about cocaine's
effects by injecting nerves with the substance directly. He learned that it
could, in fact, be used effectively as a local anesthetic, but became addicted
to cocaine in the process. </p>



<p>Eventually Halsted went to Butler Sanatorium in Rhode Island
for treatment of his cocaine addiction. At Butler, they attempted to replace
his addiction to cocaine with one to morphine. They failed, and Halsted
remained dependent on both substances for the remainder of his life. </p>



<p>“Although he had never been able to reduce the amount to
less than three grains daily, on this he could do his work comfortably and
maintain his excellent physical vigor (for he was a very muscular fellow). I do
not think that anyone suspected him – not even Welch,” wrote William Osler,
another founder of Johns Hopkins Hospital. </p>



<p>Halsted headed the surgical department of Johns Hopkins
where he met his wife, Caroline Hampton. She served as a nurse for the
hospital, and it was her, complaining of the rashes she received as a result of
the mercuric chloride Halsted used to sterilize hands before surgical
procedures, that inspired him to ask the Goodyear Rubber Company to fabricate a
pair of rubber gloves (the forebear to today's latex-free exam gloves) which
could be sterilized and used in surgical procedures. </p>



<p>“Operating in examination gloves was an evolution rather
than an inspiration or happy thought, and it is remarkable that during the four
or five years when as operator I wore them only occasionally, we could have
been so blind as not to have perceived the necessity for wearing them
invariably at the operating table,” Halsted said before he died. </p>



<p>Halsted pioneered the idea of compassionate treatment toward
the internal organs of the patients on whom he operated, and that notion
informed what have come to be called “Halsted's Principles”: </p>



<p>1.)<span
>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The gentle handling of
tissue</p>

<p>2.)<span
>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Meticulous hemostasis
(the process which causes bleeding to stop)</p>

<p>3.)<span
>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Preservation of blood
supply</p>

<p>4.)<span
>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Strict aseptic
technique (through the use of sterilization and rubber exam gloves – an
innovation which led to the use of modern, non-latex gloves)</p>

<p>5.)<span
>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Minimum tension on
tissues</p>

<p>6.)<span
>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accurate tissue
apposition</p>

<p>7.)<span
>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Obliteration of
deadspace. </p>
